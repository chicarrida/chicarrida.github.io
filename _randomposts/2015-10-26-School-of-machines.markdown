Looks like I'm going back to school, the [School of Machines, Make and Make-Believe]("http://schoolofma.org/") to attend a course about Data Visualisation. It will start on Monday, 2nd of November and will be a 4 week full time course. 

I hope to have time writing about it here. And I hope it will get a little more colourful here :)
