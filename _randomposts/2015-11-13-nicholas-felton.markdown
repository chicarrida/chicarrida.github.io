Last weekend we had a workshop with [Nicholas Felton](http://feltron.com/). I guess he is mainly known for his annual report where he visualises personal data that he gathered manually or using his selfmade app, that can be found on his website.

He gave a nice introduction to the basics of processing. For the assignment we gathered a dataset out of some magazines he brought. Pictures in relation to text, how many people on picture, how many lines of text and so on. I took a travel magazine and counted the lines in total, the lines containing 'I', 'you' and a quote. And than we did some processing sketches to visualise the information.

I visualised the data as cubes, taking the linecount for the length of the sides, as you might know, area is hard to understand for the eye. As the variation was just to big, Nicholas suggested to take the squqre root. Actually if you click on the running sketch it changes to bars.  

I did another sketch using the dataset I got from the library. Last week Monday I spent ~30min at the library writing down who brought and took books, gender, age, with children. I came up with this sketch. It is actually missing the age data.

And another sketch with the library data, using an attractor and particle class I got from Nicholas, so this is actually animated and the ages is rencered on the x-axis.
