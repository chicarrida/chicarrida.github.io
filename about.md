I will be joining [Hacker Paradise](www.hackerparadise.org) from middle of March to middle of April in Ubud, Bali, Indonesia!
I'm planning to learn JavaSript, have a look at [D3](www.d3js.org) and [THREE](http://d3js.org), maybe continue the exercises from [Code of Nature](http://natureofcode.com/) and have a look at Scala. Do Yoga, go kayaking, hiking, biking to the beach.
So I guess I'll be ending up in a nice cafe, drinking tea, looking around and trying to make up my mind :-)
