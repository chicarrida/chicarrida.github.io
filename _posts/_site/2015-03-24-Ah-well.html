<p>Not much coding going on right now, I could blame the weather or the view….</p>

<p>I continued wit my PatternRepeater, set up a new approach, still WIP. Sunday we had a Hackday. I joined a group that visualized data from <a href="http://coinmarketcap.com/">coinmarketcap</a> using <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a> - yeah! Result can be found <a href="http://cc.binaryage.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Today the it looks like its going to be more cloudy, meaning I could actually do some coding - on the other hand it also means I can go for a walk and explore Ubud - ah, well….</p>
