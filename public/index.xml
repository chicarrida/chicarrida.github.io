      <description>This is a long one!
Last year a friend and I made up this game of inventing stories based on the names of cocktails when we went out for dinner. This one I actually wrote down, et voil√°:

Once upon a time, o best beloved, a green bastard lived at the farm. It wasnt clear where he came from. It started with traces around the village, ocassional sights in the bushes and slowly, slowly he got tamed.</description>

      <description>Last weekend we had a workshop with Nicholas Felton. I guess he is mainly known for his annual report where he visualises personal data that he gathered manually or using his selfmade app, that can be found on his website.
He gave a nice introduction to the basics of processing. For the assignment we gathered a dataset out of some magazines he brought. Pictures in relation to text, how many people on picture, how many lines of text and so on.</description>

      <title>Taste of Berlin</title>

      <description>I made the shape of Berlin out of mashed potatoes as the most people living in Berlin are still germans and potatoes are very german to me. I flavoured Spandau with Vodka and pickled cucumbers, guess who lives here :) For Poland I took instant borschtsch and sauerkraut, coconutmilk and lemongrass for Vietnamese, humus and dried dates for arabian and garlic and feta cheese for the turkish people.
I asked the other participants of my course to try it and guess which taste refers to what country.</description>

      <description>Wow, the first week is over, its Saturday and I will have to get ready for the Weekend course held by Nicholas Feltron soon. But I quickly want to recap the last week. Stefanie Posavec stayed the first four days with us. On Monday we got an introduction and after lunch we all went out in to the city to gather our own data set. I first thought I&amp;rsquo;d go to a cafe to get data like how many groups, how many people on their own, how many people &amp;ldquo;communicating&amp;rdquo; via devices as human communication, or the lack of real world human communication is something pretty present in my head these days.</description>
