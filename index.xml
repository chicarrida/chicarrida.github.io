      <description>This is a long one!
Last year a friend and I made up stories based on the names of cocktails when we went out for dinner.
This one is based on the menu in the picture above and also inspired by the &amp;ldquo;Just So Stories&amp;rdquo; by Rudyard Kipling.
Once upon a time, o best beloved, a green bastard lived at the farm. It wasnt clear where he came from. It started with traces around the village, ocassional sights in the bushes and slowly, slowly he got tamed.</description>
